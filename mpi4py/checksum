# In the simplest example, the final output file should match this md5sum. 
# Output files with time stamps, version numbers and other slight variations 
# will require additional logic in test.sh.  If multiple results files, take 
# md5sums # of each, concatenate them (in the same order!) and then take 
# the md5sum of the concatenated string.

# One or more results file, must be located in output directory. 
# Space-delimited.
#
# Examples:
#
# RESULTS_FILES="results.txt"
#
# RESULTS_FILES="results1.txt results2.txt results3.txt"
#
RESULTS_FILES="results1.txt results2.txt"

# Determine MD5_SUM by running ./test.sh --checksum
# Simply running md5sum from the command-line will not 
# generate a proper checksum as test.sh uses a hash of a hash.
MD5_SUM="755db9a9ae34db1b97ab38c9ac304649"
